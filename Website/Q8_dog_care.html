		For a healthy, happy dog, proper nutrition and feeding are important. 
		To meet your dog's energy requirements, purchase brand-name food with high-quality ingredients or make your own dog food that meets established nutrient profiles.<br><br>
		
		Pet parents should ensure their dogs exercise regularly,<br> between 30 minutes and two hours daily. 
		Play fetch, go <br>for walks, make a dog  obstacle course, and play <br>indoor games for mental stimulation. <img src="dog_care.png" alt="dog_image" class="dog_image" width="400" height="300">

		Let them exercise more if you have active or working breeds, but less exercise will be ideal if you have for example, a toy breed. <br><br>
		
		Training your canine companion encourages positive habits like obedience and proper manners. 
		Crate training your puppy early will give them a safe space, as dogs love a quiet place to sleep and relax especially when you are away from home. 
		Socialization with other dogs and people helps them become confident and adaptable.<br>
